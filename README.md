## Project Charter

### Vision 

Loan payment delinquency happens when the borrower fails to make scheduled payments as both parties agreed upon at first. Late loan payments could have serious adverse consequences for both the borrowers and the lenders. For loan borrowers, delinquent loan payments would not only lead to higher penalty fees, but also have negative impacts on their credit scores, which could severely affect their ability to borrow in the future. On the other hand, loan lenders suffer from being subject to the higher risk of not being able to receive the money as scheduled and the borrower might fail to make payments for more than one payment period. 

With the intention of promoting a financially healthier loan market, this app helps both the loan borrowers and the lenders identify the possibility of loan payment delinquency, even before issuing any loans. If there is a high possibility of delinquent payment, the lender should reconsider the terms and conditions of the loans for the borrower. At the same time, the borrower should reconsider the amount he/she is borrowing. 

### Mission 

The app gives the prediction of whether a loan borrower with certain attributes faces payment delinquency risks. In order to achieve the purpose of this app, a supervised classification algorithm will be leveraged along with the most important attributes of loan borrowers. The data used for this project was obtained from this Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset.

A typical user of the app will be asked to answer a series of questions regarding the attributes of the borrower (potential attributes include total income, education level, family status, etc.). With the user input, the App is going to output the probability of delinquency payment, which can be used to make decisions on whether a payment reminder is needed or whether a new loan should be issued. 

### Success criteria 

*Model Performance Metrics*

- The AUC (Area Under Curve) score will be one of the main model performance metrics because it works well with imbalanced datasets. An AUC of 70% would indicate that the model has good performance and is ready to be deployed in the app. The exact threshold may be negotiated later on.  
- CCR (Correct Classification Rate) score is another crucial model performance metric. It gives a proxy of the model accuracy by dividing the number of correctly classified observations by the total number of observations. The targeted CCR score for the model deployment is 70%. 

*Business Metrics*

- The monthly loan delinquency rate will be an important business metric here. Through A/B testing, we will be able to see whether following the app’s guidance on granting loans would lower the monthly delinquency rate compared to the results of not following the guidance of the app. 
- Another crucial business metric is the annual revenue earned by the loan lenders. As the loan market becomes financially healthier, we would expect the loan lenders to receive regular payments and have customers (borrowers) with higher credit scores. Hence the annual revenue will be an essential metric to estimate the business impact to the lenders.

## Running the app
### 1. Initialize the database 

#### Create the database 
To create the database in the location configured in `config.py` run: 

`python run.py create_db --engine_string=<engine_string>`

By default, `python run.py create_db` creates a database at `sqlite:///data/tracks.db`.

#### Adding songs 
To add songs to the database:

`python run.py ingest --engine_string=<engine_string> --artist=<ARTIST> --title=<TITLE> --album=<ALBUM>`

By default, `python run.py ingest` adds *Minor Cause* by Emancipator to the SQLite database located in `sqlite:///data/tracks.db`.

#### Defining your engine string 
A SQLAlchemy database connection is defined by a string with the following format:

`dialect+driver://username:password@host:port/database`

The `+dialect` is optional and if not provided, a default is used. For a more detailed description of what `dialect` and `driver` are and how a connection is made, you can see the documentation [here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html). We will cover SQLAlchemy and connection strings in the SQLAlchemy lab session on 
##### Local SQLite database 

A local SQLite database can be created for development and local testing. It does not require a username or password and replaces the host and port with the path to the database file: 

```python
engine_string='sqlite:///data/tracks.db'

```

The three `///` denote that it is a relative path to where the code is being run (which is from the root of this directory).

You can also define the absolute path with four `////`, for example:

```python
engine_string = 'sqlite://///Users/cmawer/Repos/2020-MSIA423-template-repository/data/tracks.db'
```


### 2. Configure Flask app 

`config/flaskconfig.py` holds the configurations for the Flask app. It includes the following configurations:

```python
DEBUG = True  # Keep True for debugging, change to False when moving to production 
LOGGING_CONFIG = "config/logging/local.conf"  # Path to file that configures Python logger
HOST = "0.0.0.0" # the host that is running the app. 0.0.0.0 when running locally 
PORT = 5000  # What port to expose app on. Must be the same as the port exposed in app/Dockerfile 
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///data/tracks.db'  # URI (engine string) for database that contains tracks
APP_NAME = "penny-lane"
SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = True 
SQLALCHEMY_ECHO = False  # If true, SQL for queries made will be printed
MAX_ROWS_SHOW = 100 # Limits the number of rows returned from the database 
```

### 3. Run the Flask app 

To run the Flask app, run: 

```bash
python app.py
```

You should now be able to access the app at http://0.0.0.0:5000/ in your browser.

## Running the app in Docker 

### 1. Build the image 

The Dockerfile for running the flask app is in the `app/` folder. To build the image, run from this directory (the root of the repo): 

```bash
 docker build -f app/Dockerfile -t pennylane .
```

This command builds the Docker image, with the tag `pennylane`, based on the instructions in `app/Dockerfile` and the files existing in this directory.
 
### 2. Run the container 

To run the app, run from this directory: 

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 --name test pennylane
```
You should now be able to access the app at http://0.0.0.0:5000/ in your browser.

This command runs the `pennylane` image as a container named `test` and forwards the port 5000 from container to your laptop so that you can access the flask app exposed through that port. 

If `PORT` in `config/flaskconfig.py` is changed, this port should be changed accordingly (as should the `EXPOSE 5000` line in `app/Dockerfile`)

### 3. Kill the container 

Once finished with the app, you will need to kill the container. To do so: 

```bash
docker kill test 
```

where `test` is the name given in the `docker run` command.

### Example using `python3` as an entry point

We have included another example of a Dockerfile, `app/Dockerfile_python` that has `python3` as the entry point such that when you run the image as a container, the command `python3` is run, followed by the arguments given in the `docker run` command after the image name. 

To build this image: 

```bash
 docker build -f app/Dockerfile_python -t pennylane .
```

then run the `docker run` command: 

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 --name test pennylane app.py
```

The new image defines the entry point command as `python3`. Building the sample PennyLane image this way will require initializing the database prior to building the image so that it is copied over, rather than created when the container is run. Therefore, please **do the step [Create the database with a single song](#create-the-database-with-a-single-song) above before building the image**.

# Testing

From within the Docker container, the following command should work to run unit tests when run from the root of the repository: 

```bash
python -m pytest
``` 

Using Docker, run the following, if the image has not been built yet:

```bash
 docker build -f app/Dockerfile_python -t pennylane .
```

To run the tests, run: 

```bash
 docker run penny -m pytest
```
