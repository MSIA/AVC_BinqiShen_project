## Project Charter

### Vision 

Loan payment delinquency happens when the borrower fails to make scheduled payments as both parties agreed upon at first. Late loan payments could have serious adverse consequences for both the borrowers and the lenders. For loan borrowers, delinquent loan payments would not only lead to higher penalty fees, but also have negative impacts on their credit scores, which could severely affect their ability to borrow in the future. On the other hand, loan lenders suffer from being subject to the higher risk of not being able to receive the money as scheduled and the borrower might fail to make payments for more than one payment period. 

With the intention of promoting a financially healthier loan market, this app helps both the loan borrowers and the lenders identify the possibility of loan payment delinquency, even before issuing any loans. If there is a high possibility of delinquent payment, the lender should reconsider the terms and conditions of the loans for the borrower. At the same time, the borrower should reconsider the amount he/she is borrowing. 

### Mission 

The app gives the prediction of whether a loan borrower with certain attributes faces payment delinquency risks. In order to achieve the purpose of this app, a supervised classification algorithm will be leveraged along with the most important attributes of loan borrowers. The data used for this project was obtained from this [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mishra5001/credit-card) dataset.

A typical user of the app will be asked to answer a series of questions regarding the attributes of the borrower (potential attributes include total income, education level, family status, etc.). With the user input, the App is going to output the probability of delinquency payment, which can be used to make decisions on whether a payment reminder is needed or whether a new loan should be issued. 

### Success criteria 

*Model Performance Metrics*

- The AUC (Area Under Curve) score will be one of the main model performance metrics because it works well with imbalanced datasets. An AUC of 70% would indicate that the model has good performance and is ready to be deployed in the app. The exact threshold may be negotiated later on.  
- CCR (Correct Classification Rate) score is another crucial model performance metric. It gives a proxy of the model accuracy by dividing the number of correctly classified observations by the total number of observations. The targeted CCR score for the model deployment is 70%. 

*Business Metrics*

- The monthly loan delinquency rate will be an important business metric here. Through A/B testing, we will be able to see whether following the app’s guidance on granting loans would lower the monthly delinquency rate compared to the results of not following the guidance of the app. 
- Another crucial business metric is the annual revenue earned by the loan lenders. As the loan market becomes financially healthier, we would expect the loan lenders to receive regular payments and have customers (borrowers) with higher credit scores. Hence the annual revenue will be an essential metric to estimate the business impact to the lenders.

*NOTE: Please be sure to be **connected to the Northwestern VPN** and go to the **root directory** of the repository before you move forward with the following steps.*


## Build the App Using Python

### 1. Data Source 

The data used for this project was obtained from this [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mishra5001/credit-card) Kaggle dataset. Since the data is relatively small, there is a copy of the loan application data in this repository with the following path: `data/sample/application_data.csv`. 

### 2. Load data into S3 and Download data from S3

#### AWS Credentials Configuration

In order to connect to S3, you would first need to configure your AWS Credentials.
To configure AWS credentials, run the following commands in terminal to load your credentials as environment variables: 
*Note: Please remember to change the "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID" and "YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" below to your own AWS credentials*

`export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID"`

`export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"`


#### Load data into S3

Run the following command to load data to S3: 

```
python run.py upload_file_to_s3 --local_path <local_file_path> --s3path <s3_file_path>
```

Without specifying `--local_path` and `s3_path`, the default local path is: `data/sample/application_data.csv` and the default s3 path is: `s3://2021-msia423-shen-binqi/raw/application_data.csv`. 

- If you want to upload data from a different local path, specify by adding the following: 

`--local_path <local_file_path>`

- If you want to upload data to a different S3 path, specify by adding the following: 

`--s3_path <s3_file_path>`

#### Download data from S3 

This step is completely OPTIONAL. If you would like to download the data used for this project from S3, please run the following commands: 

```
python run.py download_file_from_s3 --local_path <local_file_path> --s3_path <s3_file_path>
```

Without specifying `--local_path` and `s3_path`, the default local path is: `data/sample/application_data.csv` and the default s3 path is: `s3://2021-msia423-shen-binqi/raw/application_data.csv`. 

- If you want to upload data from a different local path, specify by adding the following: 

`--local_path <local_file_path>`

- If you want to upload data to a different S3 path, specify by adding the following: 

`--s3_path <s3_file_path>`


### 3. Initialize the database 

#### Option 1: Create the Database Locally

In order to create the database locally, please run the following command to make sure that your environmental variable MYSQL_HOST is empty by running the following command:

`echo $MYSQL_HOST`

HINT: If you happen to have a MYSQL_HOST by running the command above, you may open a new terminal to make sure that the '.mysqlconfig' file is not sourced. But please remember to go to the root of this repository before you do the following steps.

Then, you can run the following command to create the database locally: 

`python run.py create_db --engine_string <YOUR_LOCAL_PATH>`

The default Engine String is: `sqlite:///data/application.db`. If you would like to store it elsewhere, please specify the engine string.

#### Option 2: Create the Database on RDS

##### Step 1: Configure Environment Variables 

This step is to prepare for creating the database on RDS. In order to create the database on RDS, you would first need to configure some environmental variables.

To configure the `.mysqlconfig` file, run: `vi .mysqlconfig` in terminal. 

Press `I` to enter the "Insert" mode and change the following variables to match your credentials. 

- `MYSQL_USER` = "YOUR_RDS_USERNAME"
- `MYSQL_PASSWORD` = "YOUR_RDS_PASSWORD"
- `MYSQL_HOST` = "YOUR_RDS_HOST_ENDPOINT"
- `MYSQL_PORT` = "YOUR_PORT"
- `DATABASE_NAME` = "YOUR_DATABASE"

After done with the above, press `esc`, type `wq`, and press `return` on your keyboard to save the changes.

Type the following command in your terminal to update the .mysqlconfig file: `source .mysqlconfig`

##### Step 2: Create the Database on RDS

To initialize an empty database on RDS, run the following command in your terminal: 

`python run.py create_db --engine_string <YOUR_LOCAL_PATH>`

Please note that if you choose to initialize an empty database on RDS, you would not be able to see the previous records that are already in the database. 

##### Test Connection to Database 

To test if you can connect to the database, you may run the following command: 

```
docker run -it --rm \
    mysql:5.7.33 \
    mysql \
    -h$MYSQL_HOST \
    -u$MYSQL_USER \
    -p$MYSQL_PASSWORD
```

If successfully connected, you may run the following commands: 

- To show all the databases: `show databases;`
- To use a particular database: `use <database_name>;`
- After selecting a database, you can see al the tables in it by running: `show tables;`
- You may check the columns within a table by running: `show columns from <table_name>;`


### 4. Model Pipeline

In this model pipeline, we will download data from S3, clean data, generate new features, one hot encode the categorical columns, and finally train a Random Forest Classifier as well as output the evaluation results.

A Random Forest Classifier was the model built to make predictions on loan delinquency for new applicants. The pre-trained model is located in this repository with the following path: `models/randomforest.joblib`. The intermediate artifacts and the model evaluation results are stored in the `data/artifacts` folder. 

If you wish to re-run the model pipeline, please run the following commands: 

- Download data from S3: 

If you do not have the raw application data in 'data/sample/application_data.csv', please refer to the 'Download data from S3' section above.

- Clean data: 

`python run.py run_model_pipeline --step clean --config=config/config.yaml --output=data/artifacts/cleaned.csv`

The resulting cleaned data will be stored in the following location: `data/artifacts/cleaned.csv` 
  
- Generate new features and one-hot-encode categorical columns: 

`python run.py run_model_pipeline --step featurize --input=data/artifacts/cleaned.csv --config=config/config.yaml --output=data/artifacts/featurized.csv`

The resulting featurized data will be stored in the following location: `data/artifacts/featurized.csv` 

- Model training and evaluation: 

`python run.py run_model_pipeline --step model --input=data/artifacts/featurized.csv --config=config/config.yaml --output=models/randomforest.joblib`

The resulting model will be stored in the following location: `models/randomforest.joblib`.

The model evaluation results (Metrics: Area Under Curve (AUC) & Correct Classification Rate(CCR)) will be stored in the following location: `data/artifacts/evaluation_results.csv`
