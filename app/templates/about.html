    <h4>VISION</h4>

    <p>
      Loan payment delinquency happens when the borrower fails to make scheduled payments as both parties agreed upon at first. Late loan payments could have serious adverse consequences for both the borrowers and the lenders. For loan borrowers, delinquent loan payments would not only lead to higher penalty fees, but also have negative impacts on their credit scores, which could severely affect their ability to borrow in the future. On the other hand, loan lenders suffer from being subject to the higher risk of not being able to receive the money as scheduled and the borrower might fail to make payments for more than one payment period.

      With the intention of promoting a financially healthier loan market, this app helps both the loan borrowers and the lenders identify the possibility of loan payment delinquency, even before issuing any loans. If there is a high possibility of delinquent payment, the lender should reconsider the terms and conditions of the loans for the borrower. At the same time, the borrower should reconsider the amount he/she is borrowing.
    </p>

    <h4>MISSION</h4>

    <p>
      The app gives the prediction of whether a loan borrower with certain attributes faces payment delinquency risks. In order to achieve the purpose of this app, a Random Forest Classifier was built along with the most important attributes of loan borrowers. The data used for this project was obtained from this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mishra5001/credit-card">Credit Card Fraud Detection</a> dataset.

      A typical user of the app will be asked to answer a series of questions regarding the attributes of the borrower/applicant (some crucial attributes include age, total income, education level, family status, etc.). With the user input, the App is going to output the probability of delinquency payment, which can be used to make decisions on whether a payment reminder is needed or whether a new loan should be issued.
